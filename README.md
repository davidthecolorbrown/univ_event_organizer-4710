# Problem
* Most universities in the country hosts events around campus and off campus. These events are organized   by   college   students   in   most   of   the   cases.    Students   are   clustered   (RSOâ€™s   or Registered Student Organizations)  by  different organizations,    clubs, fraternities around campus. These events are of different types: social, fundraising, tech talks, etc.  Now,  each university has a  website  where  they  post  their  events  for  the  upcoming  weeks.     One needs  to  check the website to add each event to his/her calendar.   These events are just official events and not  allevents  around  the  university  are  included.  Another  limitation  is  that  one  has  no  way  to  trackweekly events. 

# Project Description
* You are asked to implement a web application that solves the above problems.
* Any student may register with this application to obtain a user ID and a password.
* There are three user levels:
 * Super admin, who creates a profile for a university (name, location, description, number of students, pictures, etc.
 * Admin, who owns an RSO and may host events.
 * Student, who uses the application to look up information about the various events.
* Admins can create events with a name, event category, description, time, date, location, contact phone, and contact email address.
* A location should be selected from a map (Bing, Google, or open street map) with name, latitude, longitude, etc.
* To populate the database, one can use feeds (e.g., RSS, XML) from events.ucf.edu.
* Each admin is affiliated with one university and one or more RSOs.
* A student user can request to create a new RSO or to join an existent one.
* A new RSO can be created with at least 5 other students with the same email domain (e.g. @knights.ucf.edu), and one of them should be assigned as an admin.
* Students can view events in their university by location or by selecting the University they want to see the events from.
* They can retrieve events according to their level of access or scope. A student should be able to see all the events around their location or from RSOs they are following.
* There are different types of events (social, fundraising, tech talks, etc.):
  * Public events can be seen by everyone.
  * Private events can be seen by the students at the host university.
  * RSO events can only be seen by members of the RSO.
* Events can be created without an RSO. Such events must be approved by the super admin.
* After an event has been published, users can add, remove, and edit comments on the event, as well as rate the event with up to 5 stars.
* The application should offer some social network integration, e.g., posting from the application to Facebook or Google.

# setup mern app (NodeJS + Express + React + MySQL OR MongoDB)
## clone github repo 
* open linux/macOS terminal and navigate to directory you want to store project
    ```bash
    cd ./full/path/to/project/dir/
    ```
* get the github repo url for cloning 
    ```bash
    # repo_url: https://github.com/davidthecolorbrown/univ_event_organizer-4710.git
    git clone [repo_url] 
    ```
## install node + dependencies for backend
* first install node.js from node website
* then use node package manager (npm) to initialize project and download common dependencies (in terminal for main project directory):
    * mandatory dependencies: express, mongoose (mongodb), cors
    * common dependecies: nodemon, body-parser, bootstrap, node-fetch, moment, mocha, node-cron
    ```bash
    # install dependencies (npm uses package.json to locate dependencies)
    npm install
    # update the dependencies
    npm update 
    ```
## install react dependencies for frontend and set PORT as environment variable
* react dependencies in frontend folder
    ```bash
    # navigate to project's /frontend/ directory
    cd ./frontend/
    # download basic react app dependencies
    npm install react-router-dom axios bootstrap
    ```
* set PORT number as env variable 
    ```bash
    # create .env variable to hold frontend port info (using 8000)
    echo "PORT=8000" > ".env"
    ```
* move out of frontend directory (back to main project directory)
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
## create dev branch (if not done so already) for development
* create a new 'dev' branch and push the new branch (locally) to remote github repo
    ```bash
    # make branch
    git branch dev
    # push to github repo url
    git push origin dev
    # switch to branch
    git checkout dev
    ```
## start the backend for reading database 
* start backend by navigating to main project directory
    ```bash
    # use nodemon to restart server on changes to code
    nodemon
    # (optional) can use package manager if nodemon isn't installed
    npm start
    ```
## start frontend locally and load in browser
* browser will automatically load at 'http://localhost:[frontend-PORT]'
    ```bash
    # navigate to frontend directory 
    cd ./frontend/
    # use package manager to load in browser
    npm start
    ```
